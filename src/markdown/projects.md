#### Stats app for Player Unknown's Battlegrounds

Tags: React, React Native

Yet another PUBG stats app! This one utilizes the new PUBG developer API to show the most recent user and match stats. Once the API is out of beta the app will be production ready, so in the meantime I have the source code and an APK to download.

Say you're stuck coming up with a plan or design for your next project. This webapp helps you to quickly see at a glance what others have done. Input a keyword and a location and you'll be presented with screenshots of locations returned by the Places API.

## Electron Transcriber

#### Transcribe recorded audio

Tags: Electron, VueJS, Google Speech API

I built this application as a proof of concept to see if I could create a tool to help with note taking during meetings. Built on Electron and VueJS, it uses SOX to stream audio and Google Speech API to then transcribe it. It then stores the recording and transcription for reference later.

##### Note: this application requires SOX and Google Speech and Storage API credentials. Installation instructions are in the repository.
