# Hey, I'm Krez.

I'm not here to bore you.

I build things. I love to make things work. I take ideas and turn them into reality.

Currently I work at [19&nbsp;IDEAS](https://19ideas.com), where I build anything from simple interactive sites to complex applications.

Feel free to take a look at the rest of my work history on my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJ-Ps3fY9uqFVZavTxBsca6dU9CkeXtk/view?usp=sharing) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krez-freas-65b7bb4a/).

Let's get to work.
